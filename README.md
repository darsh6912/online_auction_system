# Online Auction System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The **Online Auction System** is a web-based platform that enables buyers and sellers to participate in digital auctions. Sellers can list their items with details such as title, description, base price, and auction duration, while buyers can place competitive bids until the auction closes.

At the end of an auction, the system automatically selects the highest bidder as the winner. This platform enhances convenience, transparency, and scalability over traditional auction systems.
