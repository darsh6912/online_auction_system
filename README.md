Online Auction System:

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The Online Auction System is a web-based platform that enables buyers and sellers to participate in digital auctions. Sellers can list their items with details like title, description, base price, and auction duration, while buyers can place competitive bids until the auction closes.

At the end of an auction, the system automatically selects the highest bidder as the winner. This platform enhances convenience, transparency, and scalability over traditional auction systems.
